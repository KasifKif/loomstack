# Loomstack

A standalone Python tool that turns a single git repo with four standard files into an autonomously-built project. You write the plan; tiered AI agents build it; you review on weekends.

Loomstack is **single-repo scoped**. It operates on whatever repo you point it at, like `git` or `cargo`. Working on a different project? `cd` to that repo, or use Weaver's multi-project mode.

## What Loomstack Is (and Isn't)

**Is:**
- A Python CLI + web dashboard for AI task orchestration
- A dispatcher that reads `PLAN.md` and routes tasks to tiered AI workers by role
- Agent adapters that wrap `claude-code` pointed at different model endpoints (local Qwen, Opus, Gemini)
- A reusable bootstrap pack you paste into Claude Code to generate new project scaffolding
- File-state based: `PLAN.md` defines work, git branches/PRs track progress, `.loomstack/` holds runs + ledger + approvals. No database.

**Isn't:**
- A multi-project manager. One repo per run. `cd` to switch (or use Weaver's sidebar selector).
- A worker framework written from scratch. Workers are `claude-code` subprocesses pointed at different endpoints per tier.

## Worker Tiers

| Role | Runtime | Endpoint | Responsibility |
|------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Classifier** | `claude-code` → Mac Mini | Qwen3-8B Q4 | First-pass triage; routes each task to the right tier |
| **Mac Worker** | `claude-code` → Mac Mini | Qwen3-8B Q4 | Lightweight reviews, doc edits, trivial refactors |
| **Code Worker** | `claude-code` → GX10 | Qwen3-Coder-Next | Primary implementation; ~70% of tasks |
| **Content Worker** | `claude-code` → GX10 (swap-in) | Qwen3-235B-A22B | Narrative, lore, complex docs |
| **Reviewer** | API client | Gemini 2.5 Flash → Pro | PR review, spec-compliance, test adequacy |
| **Architect** | `claude-code` → Anthropic | Opus 4.6 | Design, escalation, hard debugging. **Always gated by approval.** |
| **Researcher** | API client | Gemini + web search | Library vetting, upstream bug search |
| **Test Runner** | Shell | (no LLM) | Runs the project's configured CI command |

Adding a tier = one file in `blueprint/src/loomstack/agents/` + one entry in endpoint config.

## State Model (No Database)

Every piece of runtime state is a file re-read each cycle.

| State | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Task definitions | `PLAN.md` (re-parsed every cycle) |
| Task progress | Git branches + open PRs (via `gh`) |
| Per-task history + retry state | `.loomstack/runs/<task-id>.md` (multi-block frontmatter → `RunMeta`) |
| Cost audit trail | `.loomstack/ledger.jsonl` (append-only, file-locked) |
| Approval gates | `.loomstack/approvals/<task-id>` marker files |
| Agent output | Branch commits |

Daemon is stateless. Restart any time with zero data loss. `git log` is your audit trail.

## Project Repo Layout (any repo Loomstack manages)

```
your-project/
├── README.md                    ← project overview (you write)
├── CLAUDE.md                    ← project-specific agent instructions
├── PLAN.md                      ← tasks
├── loomstack.yaml               ← project config
├── .loomstack/                  ← runtime state
│   ├── runs/*.md
│   ├── ledger.jsonl
│   └── approvals/
├── .github/workflows/           ← CI that test_runner invokes
└── src/ or crates/ or lib/      ← the actual code
```

Loomstack refuses to run if any of the four top-level files are missing or invalid.

## CLI

```
loomstack init                   # scaffold the 4 files in cwd
loomstack parse                  # validate PLAN.md + show task graph
loomstack run [--once]           # dispatch ready tasks
loomstack status                 # task graph + current state
loomstack approve <task>         # unblock approval gate
loomstack escalate <task>        # force-promote to architect
loomstack cost [--since 7d]      # spend breakdown
loomstack doctor                 # health-check endpoints
loomstack weaver                 # start the Weaver web dashboard
```

## Weaver Dashboard

Weaver is a local web dashboard for monitoring and interacting with Loomstack. Built with FastAPI, Jinja2, and HTMX — no JavaScript framework, no build step.

```bash
loomstack weaver                  # start on default port (8400)
```

**Pages:**

| Page | Path | What it shows |
|------|------|---------------|
| Dashboard | `/` | Overview with health status and budget snapshot |
| Tasks | `/tasks` | Task table with status badges, dependency graph (dagre-d3), and detail side panel |
| Budget | `/budget` | Daily spend, history chart, recent ledger entries |
| Health | `/health` | Endpoint health checks |
| Chat | `/chat` | LLM chat interface for ad-hoc queries |
| Providers | `/providers` | CRUD for API provider configs (endpoint, key, cost, rate limits) |
| Workers | `/workers` | CRUD for worker tier configs (tier, provider, model, timeout) |
| Dispatcher | `/dispatcher` | Start/stop the dispatch loop; live status, cycle times, dispatch counts |

**Key features:**
- **Live task table** — auto-refreshes every 10s via HTMX; click any row for full detail panel
- **Dependency graph** — interactive DAG visualization with zoom/pan (d3 + dagre-d3)
- **Inline approvals** — approve gated tasks directly from the table; button swaps to badge without page reload
- **Run logs** — rendered markdown view of `.loomstack/runs/<task-id>.md` per task
- **Multi-project mode** — configure multiple project dirs; sidebar selector switches between them
- **Provider & worker management** — configure API endpoints and per-tier model assignments from the UI; persisted to `~/.loomstack/weaver/`
- **JSON API** — every page has a corresponding `/api/` endpoint returning JSON for scripting

Weaver is read-only for project state (it never modifies `PLAN.md` or pushes code). The dispatcher page can start/stop the dispatch loop, and the approval/provider/worker endpoints modify their respective stores.

## Bootstrap Flow

The bootstrap prompt lives at [`BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md`](./BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md) at
the repo root. It is self-contained so you can copy it into any new repo and
use it without pulling in the rest of Loomstack.

**1. Create the new project repo and clone it.**

```bash
gh repo create my-thing --private --clone
cd my-thing
```

**2. Copy `BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` into it** (so the prompt stays with the project):

```bash
cp ~/workspace/loomstack/BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md .
git add BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md && git commit -m "docs: add bootstrap prompt"
```

**3. Open a fresh Claude Opus chat** — claude.ai or `claude --model claude-opus-4-7`.

**4. Paste from `## Prompt` through the end of the file.** Include Appendix A — Opus needs the PLAN.md schema inline to produce valid tasks. Do not stop at the first `---` divider.

**5. Answer the 7 interview questions.** One-line description, language/runtime, deps, quality bar (`prototype` / `production` / `research`), architect-gated areas, v0.1 milestone, task ID prefix. Be terse — vague answers produce vague plans.

**6. Opus emits four files** in fenced blocks: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN.md`, `loomstack.yaml`. Save each into the repo (overwriting the placeholder README), then:

```bash
git add README.md CLAUDE.md PLAN.md loomstack.yaml
git commit -m "feat: initial Loomstack scaffold"
git push
```

**7. Validate `PLAN.md` parses** before letting agents loose:

```bash
cd ~/workspace/loomstack/blueprint
uv run python -c "from loomstack.core.plan_parser import parse_plan; from pathlib import Path; print(parse_plan(Path('/abs/path/to/my-thing/PLAN.md')))"
```

If it parses without raising, you're good.

**8. Start the dispatcher** — point Weaver's project sidebar at the new repo and hit Start, or `cd` in and run the dispatcher directly.

**9. Review PRs.** Approve architect-tier tasks by writing `.loomstack/approvals/<task-id>` (or via the Weaver approvals page).

~20 minutes from idea to agents running.

> **Heads up:** the README's CLI section lists `loomstack init`, `loomstack parse`, `loomstack run`, `loomstack approve` — those are aspirational. Today, validation is the Python one-liner above and dispatch runs through Weaver. Direct CLI subcommands are on the roadmap.

**Why Opus and not Code Worker?** Bootstrap planning needs strong reasoning over
the whole project shape. Code Worker (Qwen) handles the tasks Opus generates,
but is too small-context for the planning step itself.

**When to re-run the prompt.** Only at project birth. Once `PLAN.md` exists,
edit it directly — re-running the prompt would clobber task IDs and history.
For mid-project replanning, ask Opus to "extend the existing PLAN.md with
tasks for X, preserving all existing IDs."

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Loomstack

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronkam/loomstack.git ~/loomstack
cd ~/loomstack/blueprint
uv sync
```

### 2. Configure endpoints

Edit `loomstack.yaml` in your project to point each tier at your endpoints (local llama-server, Anthropic API, Google AI).

```bash
loomstack doctor                 # verify all endpoints are reachable
```

### 3. Onboard first project

```bash
cd ~/src/meshcord
loomstack init
# Edit the four files (or use bootstrap flow)
loomstack parse
loomstack run
```

## Cost Controls

- **Daily cap** in `loomstack.yaml::budget_daily_usd` (hard-stop, resets midnight UTC)
- **Architect approval gate** — Opus never runs without `.loomstack/approvals/<task>` marker
- **Reviewer defaults cheap** — Gemini Flash first; Pro only on self-flagged low confidence
- **Worker retries bounded** — 2 retries with expanded context before escalating
- **Diff size cap** — PRs over `loomstack.yaml::max_diff_loc` rejected, forcing plan decomposition

Typical monthly burn, 30-min/day cadence, one active project: **$25–$60**. Local workers free.
